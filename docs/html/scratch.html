<h1>Fortran Scratch Files</h1>

<p>Fortran lets you open a "scratch" file with
   <code>OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH',...)</code> with the restriction that
   <code>FILE="filename"</code> is not allowed on the <code>OPEN(3f)</code>. What actually
   occurs is very system-dependent.</p>

<p>So what exactly is the difference between a scratch file and a named
   external file?  For example, what are the potential advantages
   of opening a scratch file versus doing a normal named <code>OPEN</code>(3f)
   followed by closing the file later with <code>STATUS='DELETE'</code>? What are
   the disadvantages?</p>

<p>There are many extensions and differences between programming
   environments regarding scratch files. What is really
   standards-conforming? Why are there so many extensions?</p>

<p>What will you do differently if you know exactly how scratch files
   are implemented?</p>

<h2>What is a scratch file?</h2>

<p>A scratch file is a special type of external file. It is an unnamed
   temporary file intended to exist only while being used by a single
   program execution (It does not need named as the intent is that it
   will not be permanently saved to disk).</p>

<p>In all other respects, a scratch file behaves like other external
   files. So the only unique things required of a scratch file are</p>

<ul>
<li>a scratch file <strong>cannot</strong> be given a pathname on an <code>OPEN</code>(3f) with <code>FILE='some_filename'</code></li>
<li><p>when closed explicitly or at <strong>normal</strong> program termination
 a scratch file is required to be deleted. That implies you cannot do</p>

<pre><code>   `CLOSE(LUN,STATUS='KEEP',...) ! not allowed`
</code></pre>

<p>to retain a scratch file using standard Fortran.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This simple definition gives some freedom in implementation that
does not apply to typical external files. A scratch file easily might
not even be a disk file -- it might be transparently implemented in
memory or in a database, for example.  That being said scratch files
are commonly implemented as system files too.</p>

<p>Note the Fortran standard does not say other files have to be regular
   system files either, but that is generally expected outside of highly
   specialized environments.</p>

<h2>controlling the location of a scratch file</h2>

<p>So one thing special about a scratch file is the programmer is not
   permitted to specify the pathname in the OPEN(3f) of the file. This
   means the user can be provided other ways external to Fortran (or as
   an extension) to specify where the scratch data resides.</p>

<p>So many Fortran implementations use the tempnam(3c) system routine
   or an equivalent procedure to initially name the scratch file 
   when opening it at the system level.</p>

<p>Among other things this generally allows the directory name where the
   file is to be created to be controlled external to the program.</p>

<p>Typically a capability to specify where scratch files are created
   is provided via the first defined environment variable from the set
   <strong>TMPDIR</strong>, <strong>TMP</strong>, and <strong>TEMP</strong> (almost always in that order)
   without requiring access to the program code. <strong>TMPDIR</strong> is the
   preferred variable name to use. If no scratch directory is specified
   GNU/Linux and Unix  systems usually place the file in /tmp/; although
   some systems default to the current directory.</p>

<h3>Being able to control where the scratch files are generated is very important</h3>

<ul>
<li>A user can make sure scratch files are generated in a filesystem
 with sufficient space, <em>preventing filesystems from filling</em>.</li>
<li><em>performance</em> can be optimized by selecting a local disk,
 a memory-resident filesystem, or a high-speed parallel file server
 (eg. a Lustre server), as appropriate.</li>
<li>you can <em>spread out concurrent program executions</em> onto different
 resources, preventing a fileserver from being overloaded.</li>
<li><em>security</em> can be improved by placing files in private
 directories.  Not every implementation will provide unlinked files,
 which are inherently more secure than visible files; so assume the
 file will be a conventional file and make sure your file permissions
 for newly created files are as limited as possible. On GNU/Linux and Unix machines
 remember it is not only your umask(1), but kernel and OS defaults
 and fileserver options that can affect file permissions.</li>
<li>other processes can be protected by using quotaed file space so any 
 unexpected file system usage does not crash other programs.</li>
<li>if scratch files are implemented as named files it will be a
 lot easier to clean up scratch files when a program fails if you can
 place all the scratch files in a scratch directory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Having unique names generated by the system avoids a common problem</h2>

<p>Since the program cannot specify the file pathname a Fortran
   implementation is freed to use methods to make sure the scratch pathnames
   are unique, which is another aspect of such procedures as tempnam(3c).</p>

<p>If the Fortran implementation automatically uniquely names scratch
   files pathname collisions caused by multiple programs accessing the
   same filename is eliminated. Then no one has to worry about scratch
   file pathnames being duplicated and colliding even when multiple
   commands are running.</p>

<p>If your compiler does not have an option to automatically generate
   unique pathnames for scratch files <em>it should</em>.</p>

<h2>automatic cleanup for terminated processes</h2>

<p>Since there is no requirement for a scratch file to be accessible by
   other processes or to exist even after <em>abnormal</em> program termination
   the implementation can also <strong>unlink(3c)</strong> the files as soon as they
   are created.</p>

<p>If a system supports unlinking a file, then a pathname becomes
   unavailable to normal file system commands (usually immediately after
   it is created) -- e.g. it cannot be seen by the (GNU/Linux and Unix)
   ls(1) command and cannot be opened by any other normal process.</p>

<p>On most systems, unlinking the file has the advantage that the
   file will disappear when the program terminates even if the process
   terminates abnormally.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

<p>So lets say your compiler takes advantage of the special attributes of 
   a scratch file to make them go away even after abnormal termination,
   have their location controlled by external means such as the <strong>TMPDIR</strong>
   environment variable, and automatically be created with unique names
   that do not collide with other files.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>remember these features are all implementation-dependent. All
 those behaviors are allowed by the standard, but not required.
 On the other hand if your compiler does <em>not</em> do these things,
 "OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH'...)"  is really no different than opening
 a non-scratch file and closing it at program termination with
 "STATUS='KEEP'".</p></li>
<li><p>if a file is unlinked so that other system processes can no longer
 open it, you cannot easily access the data for debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>if a file is unlinked so it goes away when the process does 
 it is harder for anyone else such as a system administrator to tell
 who is using and possibly filling up a file system. A file system can
 be full but look like it has no files in it because unlinked files
 are not visible to other system commands.  Depending on your system
 you may find commands like pfiles(1), lsof(1), "netstat -vatupn" or
 "find /proc/$PID/fs" on most GNU/Linux and Unix file systems will
 let you find what files a process has open and where they reside
 even if they are unlinked.</p></li>
<li><p>Some implementations may generate a "unique" filename that is only
 unique to a particular compute node and in addition may not unlink
 the files. That means if scratch files are going into the same
 directory on a shared file system such as an NFS file server from
 different compute nodes the generated names may not be unique and
 could collide with scratch files being generated on other compute
 nodes.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>Sadly, some compilers just name scratch files something like fort.LUN
   in the current directory, nullifying almost all the potentially
   automatic advantages of opening a scratch file. That is still
   standard-conforming. So if you build with multiple compilers make sure
   your application instructions let users know where scratch files will
   be generated and how they will be named for each environment.</p>

<p>Some compilers like the IBM compiler default to acting as described
   above but have extensions to allow for naming scratch files with an
   environment variable when desired (XLSFSCRATCH_unit and the runtime
   option "scratchvars"). These extensions are particularly handy for
   debugging, as you have a pathname to a regular file you can see with
   system commands.</p>

<p>There are many other common extensions. Some PEs allow you to name
   the file when opened. Some let you do an <strong>INQUIRE(3f)</strong> and get
   the filename being used as a scratch file, and some allow you to
   close a scratch file with <code>STATUS='KEEP' and to close the file with a
   non-standard</code>NAME=<code>or</code>FILE=<code>option on</code>CLOSE(3f)`.  This is very
   non-standard and non-portable.</p>

<p>On most systems if you do not specify a filename on an <code>OPEN(3f)</code></p>

<pre><code>    `OPEN(UNIT=7)`
</code></pre>

<p>A regular system file is created, often named "fort.NNN" where NNN 
   is the unit LUN number. The filename is system-dependent. The 
   standard says </p>

<pre><code>  "If the filename is omitted and the unit is not connected to a file,
  the STATUS= specifier shall be specified with a value of SCRATCH;
  in this case, the connection is made to a processor-dependent file."
</code></pre>

<p>That sounds like it means if you do an <code>OPEN(3f)</code> on a file that is
   not preconnected without a filename that it will be a scratch file
   and be removed at program termination. I have not seen a compiler
   do that yet. Regular files like "ftn.NNN" or "fort.NNN" are usually
   created either in the current directory or where the environment
   variable <strong>TMPNAM</strong> points to.</p>

<p>Check your documentation and make sure you understand how scratch
   files are treated in your PE.</p>

<p>Here is a skeleton program that 
   gives some ideas on how to see possibly significant environment
   variables, test if your system lets you use INQUIRE(3f) to get a
   scratch file name, and pause while a scratch file is open so you
   can examine your system and see if you can see scratch files and
   what their location and permissions are:</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~ {: lang=fortran}
     program demo_scratch
     implicit none
     logical             :: ifnamed
     character           :: paws
     character(len=4096) :: filename,buffer
     integer             :: ios,lun,lun2</p>

<pre><code> write(*,*)'try to see where scratch files are open'
 write(*,*)'This is very implementation-dependent'
 write(*,*)'See your compiler documentation!'
 write(*,*)

 write(*,*)'Likely suspects if an environment variable'
 write(*,*)'is used to determine what directory a scratch'
 write(*,*)'file is written in (probably in this order):'
 write(*,*)

 buffer=' '
 call get_environment_variable('TMPDIR',buffer)
 write(*,*)'TMPDIR=',trim(buffer)
 call get_environment_variable('TMP',buffer)
 write(*,*)'TMP=',trim(buffer)
 call get_environment_variable('TEMP',buffer)
 write(*,*)'TEMP=',trim(buffer)

 ! see if you can query the pathname of a scratch file
 open(newunit=lun2) 
 inquire(unit=lun2,named=ifnamed)
 if(ifnamed)then
    inquire(unit=lun2,name=filename)
    write(*,*)'If you can see the pathname of a scratch file'
    write(*,*)'the standard does not require it ...'
    write(*,*)'filename=',trim(filename)
 endif

 ! NOTE: NOT standard, but some compilers let you specify a name 
 !       to create a named scratch file...
 !!open(newunit=lun,status='scratch',file='where_I_want')

 ! assuming you cannot see a scratch file name pause your program
 ! so you can examine your system to learn how to find where
 ! applications are putting scratch files and how to detect them
 open(newunit=lun,status='scratch')
 inquire(unit=lun,named=ifnamed)
 if(ifnamed)then
    inquire(unit=lun,name=filename)
    write(*,*)'filename=',trim(filename)
 else
    write(*,*)
    write(*,*)'file not named, so while the program is paused' 
    write(*,*)'look at what files it has open (lsof, pfiles, ....'
    write(*,'("Enter return to end program...")',advance='no')
    read(*,'(a)',iostat=ios)paws
 endif

 end program demo_scratch
</code></pre>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<h3>Big scratch files should be unformatted</h3>

<p>By definition scratch files are files the program
   interacts with as opposed to a person or other system commands.
   Therefore <em>a large scratch file should almost always be a binary file</em>
   to improve performance (versus a formatted text file). For simplicity
   that is not the case in some of the examples in this article.</p>

<h3>LUNs can be negative values even if you cannot specify a negative UNIT= value</h3>

<p>If cleaning up files like "fort.LUN", or using the LUN to build 
   filenames yourself remember the LUN number is often negative when
   using "OPEN(NEWUNIT=LUN,...)". So something like
        OPEN(NEWUNIT=LUN)
   may very well create a file such as "fort.-10".</p>

<h3>Make sure scratch files are documented</h3>

<p>A user of a program may have no idea the program is using scratch
   files, especially if they are not implemented as normal files 
   in the current directory of the process.  So if
   scratch files are not unlinked make sure they are being cleaned up
   and not left to become filesystem clutter and make sure the user
   understands the system demands made by the scratch files.</p>

<p>That is, since scratch file names are by definition system-dependent,
   it is hard to have automated system clean-up utilities or wrappers
   generically clean them up when programs abnormally terminate if
   scratch files are not unlinked files. That is why it can be handy
   to make a subdirectory for all your scratch files that is easily
   identified as scratch files, such as "/tmp/scratch.123/".</p>
