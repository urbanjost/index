# metadata

Fortran does not have a specific way to include metadata in object files
or executables. See 
[ what(1) overview ](../../download/tmp/html/what_overview.7.html)
and
[ the what(1) command ](../../download/tmp/html/what.1.html)
for a discussion about metadata and the metadata-related htools provided
by the GPF (General Purpose Fortran) collection.
