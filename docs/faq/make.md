# Build tools

The [makeout](../../download/tmp/html/makeout.1.html) program is
a simple program included in the GPF (General Purpose Fortran)
collection that helps create preliminary make(1) files. 

The GPF pre-processor is The [ufpp](../../download/tmp/html/ufpp.1.html)
program.

The GPF module
[M_verify](../../download/tmp/html/M_verify.3.html) can be used (usually
in conjunction with ufpp(1)) to create unit tests.
