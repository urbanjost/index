# FPM ENABLED GITHUB REPOSITORIES
### July 12, 2020
 
 Like others, I am trying out early releases of fpm ( 
[Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)
).  For the purpose of testing dependencies, and since there is not yet a central registry at
[https://fortran-lang.org](https://fortran-lang.org)
here is a list of my public repositories that are fpm-enabled:

    [dependencies]
     M_cli         = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_cli.git"  }
     M_calculator  = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_calculator.git" }
     M_change      = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_change.git" }
     M_color       = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_color.git" }
     M_history     = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_history.git" }
     M_io          = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_io.git" }
     M_msg         = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_msg.git" }
     M_time        = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_time.git" }
     M_process     = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_process.git" }
     M_strings     = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_strings.git" }

Which are also all available as github repositories with a Makefile build as
well:

     git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/$NAME.git

It makes it a lot easier to test a package manager if you know where a few packages are!
