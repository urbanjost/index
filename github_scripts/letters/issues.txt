MAKING NEW LIBRARY; NOT VERY FRIENDLY WITH EXISTING SETUP

Initialize an existing .git directory without
replacing README.md and src/NAME and so on hard.
Moved original directory; made new one; removed .git
and them moved files back


What is the minimum to make it manually?

C code in src/

Repository for officially released versions for stability?

List of available fpm packages?

What happened with M_calculator? Had to move src/PROGRAMS to PROGRAMS
It was automatically assuming all files in src were modules?

equivalent of make clean

what about .F90 versus .f90 and preprocessing?

any way to exclude a file that is in src?

what about INCLUDE files?

what about documentation?

When make new one, have a file that sets defaults for author, etc. like .git

Great Utility. I had to tweek it a little to work with Fortran documenation
where in the SYNTAX section a Fortran procedure usually looks like
   function NAME( 
or
   subroutine NAME(
instead of just
   NAME(

It would be nice if your original was more Fortran-friendly instead of primarily
easy to use for C-like syntax so I could just use it directly.

See the results so far at
   [Fortran Intrinsics](https://github.com/urbanjost/fortran-intrinsic-manpages)

Have your ever thought of adding an option to also generate HTML? You are already
doing the parsing and I find that I very often am converting my manpages to HTML
using manserver(1) or groff(1) which usually ends up in rather poor-quality
HTML. The *roff directives you are generating have 1-1 equivalents in HTML2 so it
seems like a natural and useful extension to your utility.

Thanks again for the great tool!
