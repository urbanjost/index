Welcome to the general-purpose-fortran wiki!

It is very empowering when you find a tool that lets you do a difficult task easily. Fortran is used to great effect to solve difficult numeric problems; but the standard core of Fortran does not address POSIX system routine interfaces, more
than basic date and time functions, graphics, regular expressions, dictionaries, database interfaces â€¦ This keeps the core language very platform-independent but at a cost to the developer. This served a more valuable purpose when every computer vendor had their own OS but that time is past. Especially now that C is available essentially everywhere Fortran is and the
ISO_C_BINDING module and associated C-binding features are available there is no intrinsic reason Fortran cannot be a one-stop shop for a much greater variety of functions than just numeric calculations. To prove that, add just such an interface
here so Fortran empowers more people.  Be one of the people that empowers Fortran!

There is nothing more convincing in an argument about what should be available in the core standard than a working example in heavy demand.
