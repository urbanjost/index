# Shell scripts

## Intro

There are certain shell scripts I miss immediately when I run in a new
environment. I started to put them here. Initially I am concentrating
on bash(1) shell scripts.

### Cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/scripts

## Dependencies

A Linux or Unix or CygWin system with the bash(1) shell is assumed.
